    "description": "In the late 1930s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) drew investment “security” maps, marking areas by determined safety of investment. The “security” of these areas were determined by racial composition of inhabitants then color-coded, with red marking what were considered to be “hazardous” investments in majority Black neighborhoods. The impact of redlining is still seen today. Redlined areas have been shown to have a statistically significant association with CSA life expectancy and age-differentiated mortality. <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8769359/#:~:text=In%20the%201930s%2C%20the%20Home,a%20process%20known%20as%20redlining'>You can learn more about the history of redlining in Baltimore here.</a> Below are visualizations of the impact that redlining has on communities, specifically in the Baltimore area."

SNAP is meant to provide food and nutrition security to households that are unable to economically sustain access to ample food supplies and is one of the most widely known social safety net programs that is used."

Graph B shows that the rate of service requests for dirty streets and alleys through Baltimore's 311 system per 1,000 residents. More than one service request may be made for the same issue but is logged as a unique request."

    "description": "This graph shows the percentage of persons over the age of 18 registered to vote out of all persons 18 years and over in each of the CSAs. It is important to consider this metric when it comes to sustainability since many elected leaders campaign on platforms promising changes meant to improve the environment and curb the effects of climate change."

    "description": "This graph shows the number of 911 calls related to overdose during 2020. The data shows that 2020 saw an uptick in overdose incidents across the city in most CSAs, which can be attributed to the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Periods of social isolation, feelings of anxiety, and limited in-person resources and assistance have contributed to the rise in overdose and substance misuse incidents."

    "description": "This graph demonstrates the differences in life expectancy for individuals born in Baltimore by Community Statistical Area, as of 2018. The stark differences in life expectancy across the different neighborhoods and zip codes of the city signify the inequitable distribution of healthcare resources and outcomes caused by differences in the built environment, as well as social and economic forces. Much of the data provided here suggests that redlining is still a prevalent problem today. Hover over different areas of the map to see individual data points by region."

Due to systemic disparities in resource allocation, however, students attending Baltimore City Public Schools in areas with high percentages of African American students are statistically more likely to switch schools and be chronically absent."

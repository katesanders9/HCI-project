    "description": "This graph shows the number of 911 calls related to overdose during 2020. The data shows that 2020 saw an uptick in overdose incidents across the city in most CSAs, which can be attributed to the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Periods of social isolation, feelings of anxiety, and limited in-person resources and assistance have contributed to the rise in overdose and substance misuse incidents."

    "description": "This graph demonstrates the differences in life expectancy for individuals born in Baltimore by Community Statistical Area, as of 2018. The stark differences in life expectancy across the different neighborhoods and zip codes of the city signify the inequitable distribution of healthcare resources and outcomes caused by differences in the built environment, as well as social and economic forces. Much of the data provided here suggests that redlining is still a prevalent problem today. Hover over different areas of the map to see individual data points by region."

    "description": "This graph demonstrates the differences in life expectancy for individuals born in Baltimore by Community Statistical Area, as of 2018. The stark differences in life expectancy across the different neighborhoods and zip codes of the city signify the inequitable distribution of healthcare resources and outcomes caused by differences in the built environment, as well as social and economic forces. Much of the data provided here suggests that redlining is still a prevalent problem today. Hover over different areas of the map to see individual data points by region."
